    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "In the tiger POMDP, the agent is tasked with escaping from a room. There are two doors leading out of the room. Behind one of the doors is a tiger, and behind the other is sweet, sweet freedom. If the agent opens the door and finds the tiger, it gets eaten (and receives a reward of -100). If the agent opens the other door, it escapes and receives a reward of 10. The agent can also listen. Listening gives a noisy measurement of which door the tiger is hiding behind. Listening gives the agent the correct location of the tiger 85% of the time. The agent receives a reward of -1 for listening. "

QMDP assumes that all state uncetainty dissapears in the next time step. This could lead to bad policies in problems with information gathering actions. For example, in the tiger POMDP listening is an information gathering action, and the resulting QMDP policy is quite poor. However, QMDP can work very well in problems where the state uncertainity is not impacted by the agent's action (for example systems with noisy sensor measurements)."
