    "In this tutorial, we try to provide a simple example of how to define a Markov decision process (MDP) problem using the [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/sisl/POMDPs.jl) interface. After defining the problem in this way, you will be able to use the solvers that the interface supports. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use the value iteration and the Monte Carlo Tree Search solvers that the POMDPs.jl interface supports. We assume that you have some knowledge of basic programming, but are not necessarily familiar with all the features that exist in Julia. We try to cover the many language specific features used in POMDPs.jl in this tutorial. We do assume that you know the grid world problem, and are familiar with the formal defintion of the MDP.

    "In Grid World, we are trying to control an agent who has trouble moving in the desired direction. In our problem, we have a four reward states on a $10\\times 10$ grid. Each position on the grid represents a state, and the positive reward states are terminal (the agent stops recieveing reward after reaching them). The agent has four actions to choose from: up, down, left, right. The agent moves in the desired direction with a probability of 0.7, and with a probability of 0.1 in each of the remaining three directions. The problem has the following form:\n",
